# GreedCave

This is a game done for the 4th Game Design Club challenge (Arcade) at the Universidade LusÃ³fona Game Development degree.

## Story

Comming soon...

## Tech stuff

* Adapted bitcula's [Universal LPC Spritesheet Unity Importer] to auto slice the LPC sprites. LPC spritesheets filename must start with "LPC_".
* Created a helper Editor script (accessible by right-clicking on a LPC image, selecting Assets>LPC>Create Animations) that create the animation override controller and the animation clips for any LPC spritesheet. The base animation controller is hardcoded to be on the "Assets/Animations/Base/BaseAnimations.controller" file, but you can easily change that.
  * This has now been moved to the UnityCommon library
* Created a custom shader for sprites in 3d space, featuring:
  * Uses emissive and normal secondary textures on the sprite
  * Has a flash functionality, which uses the alpha channel of the color to lerp between base color and the texture, for effects
  * Has correct shadows (needed to expose a AlphaThreshould variable on the shader)
* Cave map is procedurally generated using a parametrized celular automata (underpopulation at 2, no overpopulation, birth from 4 onwards). If you don't know what this means, check out this article on how to [Generate Random Cave Levels Using Cellular Automata]. You can also check Wikipedia's article on Celular Automata and Conway's Game of Life (just because they're cool!)
